# Introduction 
In this second module, I began working with the data I collected during the graveyard project for the first time, and I realized how significant and detrimental errors in data can be in archaeology. The second and third modules showed be how to manipulate the data and how to represent it visually, along with other methods of finding associations between data sets. This module taught me how to examine and manipulate data, but it also taught me about the various biases that occur in not just archaeology, but in many different fields as well, and that the only way to collect good data is by consciously aknowledging these biases in order to overcome them.

## Fail

I think that biases and errors in my graveyard data was a fail for me in week 5, since it reduced the accuracy of the information I had collected. Though, these errors mainly occurred due to the KoboToolbox forms which didn't accomodate some of the information which I would have preferred to record. I also encountered difficulties in working with the SQL portion, which surprised me since I have worked with SQL in the past and I have successfully connected to databases before. Week 6 went rather smoothly aside from the lateness, similarly to Week 7.

## Win

One of the bigger wins of this module was that I learned the various was of how data is collected in digital archaeology. From data maipulation to visual analysis, understanding how data is used and collected gave me insight on what kind of opportunities this might lead to in the future. I'm leaving this module with a deeper understanding of data analysis and of it's uses in the real world. I also worked on comparing parts of the readings with the data I was working with. I would ask mself questions like "How does race and gender play into this data? Is this data biased because of it?", and thinking in this manner opened my eyes to a new way of looking at digital archaeology, as almost like this imperfect mess of information that we somehow have to make sense of. It also helps answer some of my questions like why many old sources aren't as credible compared to newer ones.


## Challenges

There were certain challenges I had during this module which affected how I was able to get work done. This mostly involved time management, but there were other challenges along the way which affected me. One of the main ones was not being able to connect to the SQL database for the graveyard project, which meant that I wasn't able to do that excercise.

## Implications?

In digital archaeology, data processing is very important in order to draw certain conclusions which can be further researched in the future. The collection and analysis of data means that there will be more information available for us to study and analyse in the future. Even older, previously collected data can be analysed and used for things like 

## Previous Feedback

Because of the way I had handed things in late, I wasn't able to get feedback in the regular way for this module. So, for feedback, I will be looking back at module 1 and the "Consolidation II digiarch general feedback" email which was sent out to the class. The main feedback for module 1 that I worked on was regarding tying the readings to the work instead of the other way around. Regarding the email, I tried to format this document the best I could to work with the suggestions.

## Changes I'm making moving forward

Not quite changes based on the feedback, but more on the adjustment made to allow me to finish the semester on time. I'll be focusing more on the readings and I will be basing the next consolidation document based only on that, instead of the excercises. Things will be a little different moving forward, but I'm very thankful for this opportunity.
